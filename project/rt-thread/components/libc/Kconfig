        This is for external libc(e.g. mlib),
        and NOT for newlib or picolibc which are inherent in the toolchains.
        Usually, the external libc should be a software package and select
        RT_USING_EXTERNAL_LIBC in software package's Kconfig
        This option is not available for users to select.
